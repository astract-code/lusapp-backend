Yes, the format is **correct** with the `@` symbol — that's the standard way Expo structures the proxy redirect URI for apps using `expo-auth-session` (especially in Expo Go or development builds).

The full authorized redirect URI should be:  
**https://auth.expo.io/@biterdi/lusapp**

### Why this is right
- Expo's auth proxy uses this pattern: `https://auth.expo.io/@<expo-username>/<project-slug>`
- `<expo-username>` is your Expo account username (here: `biterdi`).
- `<project-slug>` is the app name/slug from your `app.json` or `app.config.js` (e.g., `"slug": "lusapp"`).
- The `@` is required — it's part of the path, separating the username from the project.
- Many official Expo docs and tutorials explicitly show examples like:
  - `https://auth.expo.io/@your-username/your-app-slug`
  - Or `https://auth.expo.io/@expo/example-app`
- Without the `@`, it would be invalid and cause redirect_uri_mismatch errors.

### Quick checks to confirm it's working for your setup
1. In your `app.json` / `app.config.js`, verify:
   ```json
   {
     "expo": {
       "name": "Lusapp",
       "slug": "lusapp",
       "owner": "biterdi",  // optional but good to have
       ...
     }
   }
   ```
   - The slug must match exactly what you put after the `/` (case-sensitive).

2. In your code (using `expo-auth-session`), make sure you're generating the redirect URI correctly:
   ```js
   import * as AuthSession from 'expo-auth-session';

   const redirect = AuthSession.makeRedirectUri({ useProxy: true });
   // This should return something like: https://auth.expo.io/@biterdi/lusapp
   ```
   - If you're in Expo Go, `useProxy: true` is what triggers the `auth.expo.io` proxy.
   - For standalone/development builds, you might switch to a custom scheme (e.g., `lusapp://`), but for now/testing, the proxy is fine.

3. In Google Cloud Console (for your **Web application** Client ID):
   - You've already added: `https://auth.expo.io/@biterdi/lusapp`
   - Make sure there are no typos (e.g., no extra spaces, correct casing for `biterdi` and `lusapp`).
   - If testing in Expo Go, this is the one that matters for the web flow proxy.
   - Save and wait 5–30 minutes (or longer) for propagation.

4. Important note for Android/native flows:
   - The error you showed earlier had `redirect_uri=lusapp://` — that's your **custom scheme**, which is used in standalone builds or when `useProxy: false`.
   - For that to work, you need:
     - An **Android** OAuth Client ID (not just Web) with your package name and SHA-1.
     - The "Enable custom URI scheme" checkbox turned on (as we discussed before).
   - If you're currently testing in Expo Go → stick with the proxy URI above (no custom scheme needed yet).
   - If building a standalone app (eas build or dev client) → add your custom scheme URI (e.g., `lusapp://`) to the **Authorized redirect URIs** in the **Web** client ID as well (Google sometimes requires it even for native).

### Next steps if still failing
- Run your app and log the redirect URI being used (console.log it from `makeRedirectUri()`).
- Compare it exactly to what's in Google Console.
- If it's using `exp://` or something else → set `useProxy: true` explicitly.
- Test with a fresh Expo Go session (close/reopen the app).

This should resolve the "doesn't comply" / invalid_request issues tied to the redirect. If you share what `makeRedirectUri()` outputs in your code (or if you're using a different library like `@react-native-google-signin`), I can help further!
