erfect — these screenshots tell me exactly what’s wrong.
Your React Native app crashed because of a capitalization and JSX error in your AppNavigator.js file, specifically in the tabBarIcon definition.

Let’s fix it step-by-step 👇

🚨 The error explained

The key error is:

Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component.


and

View config getter callback for component `text` must be a function (received `undefined`).
Make sure to start component names with a capital letter.


This means somewhere in your JSX, you wrote <text> (lowercase) instead of <Text> (uppercase).

In React Native, all built-in components like View, Text, Image, etc., must be capitalized.
A lowercase <text> is treated as an unknown HTML element, which React Native doesn’t understand.

🧭 Where it’s happening

From your screenshot:

options={{
  tabBarLabel: 'Feed',
  tabBarIcon: ({ color }) => <text style={{ color }}>🏃</text>
}}


That lowercase <text> is the problem.

✅ The Correct Fix

Replace <text> with <Text> and import it from react-native.

So the working version should be:

import { Text } from 'react-native';
import { Ionicons } from '@expo/vector-icons'; // or whichever icon set you use

// inside your Tab.Screen
<Tab.Screen
  name="Feed"
  component={FeedScreen}
  options={{
    tabBarLabel: 'Feed',
    tabBarIcon: ({ color }) => (
      <Ionicons name="ios-fitness" size={24} color={color} />
    ),
  }}
/>

🧠 Why this matters

React Native doesn’t use lowercase HTML-like tags.
If you need to display text, always use <Text>.
If you’re just showing an icon, use a vector icon component instead of a text emoji string.

🧩 Optional improvement

If you still want to use an emoji instead of an icon, that’s fine — just make sure to wrap it in <Text>:

tabBarIcon: ({ color }) => <Text style={{ color }}>🏃</Text>


That works too.

✅ Summary

Fix summary:

Replace <text> with <Text>

Import Text from 'react-native'

Optionally switch to vector icons via @expo/vector-icons

After saving that change, reload your app in Expo Go — the red screen should disappear immediately.

Would you like me to show you the correct structure of AppNavigator.js (with a bottom tab navigation setup using Expo + React Navigation) so you can compare and be sure everything is right?
