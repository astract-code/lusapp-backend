### TODO List for Troubleshooting Google Sign-In on Android

Follow these steps one by one to diagnose and fix the "Error 400: invalid_request" issue. This error often stems from OAuth configuration problems in the Google Cloud Console, such as missing settings for your Android client ID. I'll assume you're using the standard Google Sign-In SDK (e.g., via Firebase or directly with Google Play Services). If you're using a cross-platform framework like Flutter or React Native, the core setup is similar, but check your library's docs for platform-specific tweaks.

1. **Verify your app's SHA-1 fingerprint**:
   - For a debug build: Run `keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android` in your terminal (on macOS/Linux; adjust for Windows).
   - For a release build: Use `keytool -list -v -keystore path/to/your/release.keystore` with your keystore details.
   - Note the SHA-1 value (it looks like XX:XX:XX:...). You'll need this for the next steps. If testing a debug build, use the debug SHA-1; for production, use the release one.

2. **Check or create an Android OAuth 2.0 Client ID in Google Cloud Console**:
   - Go to [console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
   - Select your project (or create one if none exists).
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID".
   - Set "Application type" to "Android".
   - Enter your app's package name (e.g., from `build.gradle` file: `applicationId "com.example.lusapp"`).
   - Enter the SHA-1 fingerprint from step 1.
   - Create the client ID if it doesn't exist.

3. **Enable Custom URI Scheme for your Android Client ID**:
   - In the Credentials page, click on your Android client ID (e.g., "Android client 1").
   - Scroll down to "Advanced settings".
   - Check the box for "Enable custom URI scheme" (ignore any warnings about it being for older apps—it's often required for native sign-in flows).
   - Click "Save".
   - Wait 5–10 minutes (or up to a few hours) for changes to propagate. Test again after this wait.

4. **Set up or verify Web Client ID (if using ID tokens for server verification)**:
   - If your app requests an ID token (e.g., for backend auth), you need a Web application client ID.
   - In Credentials, create one if missing: "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID" > "Web application".
   - No specific fields needed for Android, but note the Client ID value.
   - In your Android code, ensure `GoogleSignInOptions` uses this Web Client ID: e.g., `.requestIdToken("your-web-client-id")`.
   - If using Firebase, this is auto-generated—skip to step 5.

5. **Integrate or update Firebase configuration (if using Firebase Auth)**:
   - Go to [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com).
   - Add your Android app if not already (provide package name and SHA-1).
   - Download the latest `google-services.json` file.
   - Place it in your app's `app/` directory.
   - In Firebase console > Authentication > Sign-in method, enable "Google".
   - Rebuild and test your app.

6. **Verify OAuth Consent Screen settings**:
   - In Google Cloud Console > APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen.
   - Ensure "App name" matches "Lusapp" (as shown in the error).
   - Set "User support email" to a valid email (e.g., evapazatibo@gmail.com).
   - If "Publishing status" is "Testing", add your test email (evapazatibo@gmail.com) as a test user under "Test users".
   - If in "Production", consider app verification if using sensitive scopes (but basic email/profile shouldn't require it).
   - Save changes and wait 5 minutes.

7. **Update your app's Google Sign-In implementation**:
   - Ensure you're using the latest Google Play Services Auth library: In `build.gradle`, add `implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth:20.7.0'` (or newer; check for updates).
   - In code, use the standard setup:
     ```
     GoogleSignInOptions gso = new GoogleSignInOptions.Builder(GoogleSignInOptions.DEFAULT_SIGN_IN)
         .requestEmail() // Add .requestIdToken(webClientId) if needed
         .build();
     GoogleSignInClient mGoogleSignInClient = GoogleSignIn.getClient(this, gso);
     // Then start sign-in: startActivityForResult(mGoogleSignInClient.getSignInIntent(), RC_SIGN_IN);
     ```
   - Avoid manual OAuth flows or WebView—use the native API to comply with Google's security policies.
   - If using a library (e.g., google_sign_in for Flutter), update to the latest version and recheck platform setup.

8. **Test the sign-in flow**:
   - Clean and rebuild your app (e.g., `./gradlew clean assembleDebug`).
   - Uninstall and reinstall the app on your device/emulator.
   - Attempt Google sign-in again.
   - If the error persists, click "detalles del error" (error details) in the popup for more info (e.g., it might mention "Custom URI scheme is not enabled").
   - Try with a different Google account or disable VPN (as shown in your screenshot).

9. **Check for additional errors or logs**:
   - In Android Studio, check Logcat for GoogleSignIn errors (filter by "GoogleSignIn").
   - If using Firebase, check Firebase console > Authentication for failed attempts.
   - Search the exact detailed error message online if it provides more clues.

10. **If nothing works, seek developer support**:
    - Post in Google Identity forums or Stack Overflow with your client ID type, code snippet, and full error details (anonymize sensitive info).
    - Contact Google support via the console if your app is verified.

This should cover the most common causes. Start from the top, as the Custom URI scheme enablement (step 3) resolves many "invalid_request" issues for Android apps. If you provide more details (e.g., your code snippet, framework, or full error details), I can refine this further.
